	abstract = {A central theme of network science is the heterogeneity present in real-life systems, for instance through the absence of a characteristic degree for the nodes. Despite their small-worldness, networks may present other types of heterogeneous patterns, with different parts of the network exhibiting different behaviors. Here we focus on assortativity, a network analogue of correlation used to describe how the presence and absence of edges covaries with the properties of nodes. We design a method to characterize the heterogeneity and local variations of assortativity within a network and exhibit, in a variety of empirical data, rich mixing patterns that would be obscured by summarizing assortativity with a single statistic.Assortative mixing in networks is the tendency for nodes with the same attributes, or metadata, to link to each other. It is a property often found in social networks, manifesting as a higher tendency of links occurring between people of the same age, race, or political belief. Quantifying the level of assortativity or disassortativity (the preference of linking to nodes with different attributes) can shed light on the organization of complex networks. It is common practice to measure the level of assortativity according to the assortativity coefficient, or modularity in the case of categorical metadata. This global value is the average level of assortativity across the network and may not be a representative statistic when mixing patterns are heterogeneous. For example, a social network spanning the globe may exhibit local differences in mixing patterns as a consequence of differences in cultural norms. Here, we introduce an approach to localize this global measure so that we can describe the assortativity, across multiple scales, at the node level. Consequently, we are able to capture and qualitatively evaluate the distribution of mixing patterns in the network. We find that, for many real-world networks, the distribution of assortativity is skewed, overdispersed, and multimodal. Our method provides a clearer lens through which we can more closely examine mixing patterns in networks.},

abstract = {Summary The paper provides statistical theory and intuition for personalized PageRank (called ‘PPR’): a popular technique that samples a small community from a massive network. We study a setting where the entire network is expensive to obtain thoroughly or to maintain, but we can start from a seed node of interest and ‘crawl’ the network to find other nodes through their connections. By crawling the graph in a designed way, the PPR vector can be approximated without querying the entire massive graph, making it an alternative to snowball sampling. Using the degree-corrected stochastic block model, we study whether the PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node. We provide a simple and interpretable form for the PPR vector, highlighting its biases towards high degree nodes outside the target block. We examine a simple adjustment based on node degrees and establish consistency results for PPR clustering that allows for directed graphs. These results are enabled by recent technical advances showing the elementwise convergence of eigenvectors. We illustrate the method with the massive Twitter friendship graph, which we crawl by using the Twitter application programming interface. We find that the adjusted and unadjusted PPR techniques are complementary approaches, where the adjustment makes the results particularly localized around the seed node, and that the bias adjustment greatly benefits from degree regularization.},

	abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},
